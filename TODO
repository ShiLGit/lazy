        -           spaghetti approach for comments?
            1) Use traditional file IO to read in each line. if encountering comment about "overriding versions" (--> line matches regex), wrap it in an <OVERRIDE> tag so it's queryable by xml --> you know where to insert overriding dependencies when resolving vulns. Then go back and delete the <OVERRIDE> tag when everything is done
